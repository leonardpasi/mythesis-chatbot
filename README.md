## Setup and Configuration

Before running the project, you'll need to configure your environment with your personal OpenAI API key.

1. **Create a `.env` File**:  
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project (same directory as this README).

2. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**:  
   Inside the `.env` file, add your OpenAI API key like this:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY="your-personal-api-key-here"
